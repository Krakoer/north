# North : Yet Another Language for the W65c02 

This work is fully inspired by the amazing Porth by Tsoding Daily :
    - Source code : https://github.com/tsoding/porth
    - Youtube serie : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4

The language is intended to work on the 6502 Ben eater computer : see https://eater.net/6502

It make use of a library I intend to share in a near future, heavily based on the 6502 stack ressource https://wilsonminesco.com/stacks/ and the 6502 bootloader sixty5o2 https://github.com/janroesner/sixty5o2
